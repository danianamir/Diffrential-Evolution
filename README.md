# Diffrential-Evolution
In this project, I implemented the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm, a powerful optimization technique used for solving complex problems by iteratively improving candidate solutions. DE works by maintaining a population of potential solutions and evolving them over time through operations like mutation, crossover, and selection. The algorithm generates new solutions by combining existing ones, using differences between them to explore the solution space effectively. This approach allows DE to find optimal or near-optimal solutions even in challenging, high-dimensional landscapes. My implementation focuses on applying DE to optimize parameters in the context of reinforcement learning for game level generation.
