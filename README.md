# Diffrential-Evolution
In this project, I implemented the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm as part of the optimization process for generating game levels. Differential Evolution is a population-based optimization algorithm used for solving complex multi-dimensional problems. It works by iteratively improving a population of candidate solutions through mutation, crossover, and selection processes. In each iteration, a new candidate solution is generated by combining the properties of existing solutions, and if the new solution offers a better fitness value, it replaces the previous one. This method is particularly effective for optimizing non-linear, non-differentiable, and multi-modal functions, making it suitable for fine-tuning the parameters involved in game level generation and ensuring the generated levels meet the specified constraints.
